# Detecting zones of anomalously high number of traffic accidents in Berlin

This project aims to create a model that will predict traffic accidents in Berlin using traffic flow detectors data (speed, volume, etc.) and find zones where the number of accidents is higher than can be expected from that data. This may help to identify underlying infrastructural problems in the city.

Project uses 2021 data form the following datasets:
1) The first dataset was compiled by Berlin’s Senatsverwaltung Umwelt, Verkehr und Klimaschutz.  It provides traffic flow detection data and can be found here: https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/verkehrsdetektion-berlin
2) The second dataset was compiled by compiled by Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg. It provides traffic accidents data and can be found here: https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/stra%C3%9Fenverkehrsunf%C3%A4lle-nach-unfallort-berlin-2021

To correctly run the project, you will need your own Mapbox token. Please provide it in the code instead of the placeholder.
